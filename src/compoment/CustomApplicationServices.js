                      Custom software development is the process of designing,
                      creating, deploying and maintaining software for a
                      specific set of users, functions or organizations. In
                      contrast to commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS),
                      custom software development aims at a narrowly defined set
                      of requirements. COTS targets a broad set of requirements,
                      allowing it to be packaged and commercially marketed and
                      distributed.

                    <p>
                      Microsoft Office and Sitebuilder.com, for example, are
                      packaged commercial software products and services. They
                      meet the generalized needs of office productivity and
                      website creation.

                      Custom software, on the other hand, is designed for a

                      Custom software, and its development, is also referred to
                      as <strong>bespoke software</strong>. The term has its

                    <p>Some of the benefits include:</p>

                    <ul className="digimonk-list">
                      <li>
                        <strong>Efficiency: </strong>Custom software is
                        purpose-built to support processes swiftly and
                        productively, without the need to tinker with or adjust
                        COTS applications.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Scalability:</strong> Custom software can grow
                        as an organization or business grows and changes.
                        Designers and developers can assess future needs as part
                        of their requirements gathering. These factors can then
                        be incorporated into the application, rather than
                        incurring costs by purchasing additional licenses or
                        subscriptions of packaged applications.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Lower integration costs:</strong> One of the
                        chief considerations of commercial software is: will it
                        work with existing and legacy applications? If the
                        answer is no, organizations face a further investment in
                        getting commercial software to communicate and operate
                        with their existing infrastructure. Custom software can
                        be built to integrate with its intended environment.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Profitability:</strong> It’s possible to make
                        money with custom software development. Depending on the
                        terms and conditions of the project, businesses that
                        develop their own software may own the software and
                        therefore be able to license or sell it to other
                        organizations.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Independence:</strong> The benefits of being
                        free of a commercial software vendor cut both ways. On
                        the plus side, organizations can avoid price hikes for
                        licensing and support — and getting stuck maintaining
                        packaged software should the vendor go out of business
                        or terminate a product. On the negative side, the cost
                        of supporting and maintaining custom software falls to
                        the organization that created it or had it developed.
                        How the equation works out requires each organization to
                        look carefully at whether it’s better to build or buy.
